## User Study: Identification of breaking changes in clients

Welcome to the user study on analyzing breaking dependency updates in a Java project using Maven!
In this study, we will explore how to identify compilation failures using the resources provided in this repository.

### Study Objective

- Identify compilation failures in a Java project using logs generated by Maven.
- Understand the bugs provided in a Java project through detailed explanations.

## Available Resources

In this repository, you will find the following resources in each Case folder:
1. Java project
   Folder that contains the Java project that has compilation failures.
2. Maven Logs `maven.log`:
   - The `maven.log` file contains Maven-generated logs during the build process of the original project. Participants are required to identify and count the number of breakages based on this file.
3. Explanations `Explanation.md`:
   - The `Explanation.md` file provides detailed explanations for each breaking update that was present in the project. Participants should use this explanation to identify each failure.
